# Implementation:

#### Q) What libraries did you add to react-native? What are they used for?

@react-navigation/native - used for the navigtion of app
@reduxjs/toolkit - used for state management for the app
@rneui/base - favorite library for best UI components in react native
react-native-gesture-handler - library provide the tap and gesture management supprot to react native
react-native-modal - used for the financial modal and recommended for using modal
react-native-vector-icons - library used for using icons in the react native from third party services like entypo,antdesign,ionicons etc

#### Q) What's the command to start the application locally?

npm install or yarn
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
npx react-native run-android # For running on Android
npx react-native run-ios # For running on iOS

#### Q) Any other comments we should read before evaluating your solution?

- In terms of design, as Assets/Fonts were not provided so i used the most relavant assets in the design to look better.  
- I have used Javascript due to some timelines issues.
- Typscript gives you much code maintainability which i will look forward to improve in it
- I would like to say this test task is just the intial coding look but when actaul app is designed and development, then will use the more advanced and effiecnt ways. This is just an start
- Looking forward for the comments/improvements

#### Q) How much time did you take to complete the assessment?

- It took almost 3-4 days for me to complete due to tight schedule
- I will thank you for consideration and favor on estimations

# General:

#### Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?

- I would like to move this to Typescript.
- I would like to improve the UI structure and render app over 60 fps
- I would like to write Unit test for the app to make it more reliable
- I would like to improve the coding strucutre
- I would like to introduce the auto deployment service like fastlane in the project
- I would like to make app more module approach as much as i can
- I would like to detect the performance using Xcode and android studio and remove extra re-renders
- I would like to introduce cache and memory enhancements

For now these are the improvements i would like to do but as development is ongoing process so according to new architecture, more and more improvements can be done.

#### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?

- I am proud of Mock Functionality due to redux-toolkit.
- Reason is as from start, i was using Redux and code was not so good and management in terms of performance as well. Redux tookit comes with solution with less code, much performance and efficient code.
- On the other hand, i am proud of Markets Scren Design due to providing the user more user-friendly experience by Top Tabs and Bottom Tabs.
- I am also proud of that Project has passed the ESLINT standards.

#### Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?

I spent a bit more time on Markets screen because it was Tops tabs with Bottom Tabs. There was no difficulty i felt because i have done it already many times

#### Q) How did you find the test overall? Did you have any issues or have difficulties completing? If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them.

- Overall, i would say Test was good. Test Modals were easy to understand and FOLLOW-UP.md was very friendly
- One suggestion i would like to give is that in these type of test, Project should have alreay with required assets that will be used in the design just like images/svgs/icons/fonts. Because from Screenshots, candiate will choose assets from random internet that can make his impression on company a bit not good.

Overall it was a great test. Really enjoyed doing it and happy to complete it and deliver it.
